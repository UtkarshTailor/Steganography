# 🔐 Steganography Web App with Streamlit

This is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to **hide (encode)** and **extract (decode)** secret messages in images using **three different steganography techniques**:

- **LSB (Least Significant Bit)**
- **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)**
- **DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)**

> Built with simplicity in mind, this app provides a visual and intuitive interface for data hiding techniques, suitable for learning, experimenting, or basic security applications.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Upload and encode messages into images.
- 🧠 Extract hidden messages from encoded images.
- 💾 Download encoded images with embedded secrets.
- ✨ Choose between LSB, DCT, or DWT steganography.
- 🧪 Approximate message length input for better DWT decoding.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UtkarshTailor/Steganography.git
cd Steganography
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed, then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy pillow opencv-python pywavelets


### 3. Run the App

```bash
python -m streamlit run StreamLit/file.py
```

Open the app in your browser when prompted, or visit: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## 📸 Supported File Types

- PNG
- JPG / JPEG

> PNG is recommended for best quality during encoding/decoding.
